"""Lazy connection to a running DaVinci Resolve Studio instance.

The Resolve scripting API is served by the bundled ``fusionscript`` native
module, reachable from an external process only when Resolve Studio is running
with External scripting set to Local (Preferences, System, General). This module
finds that library across platforms, connects once, caches the handle and
revives it if Resolve restarts.
